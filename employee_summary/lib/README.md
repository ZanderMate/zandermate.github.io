Upon opening up the command line, you will be prompted about the manager information (name, ID number, email, and office number). 

From there, it will ask about the engineers on the team. If there are any, it will ask for their name, ID number, email address, and GitHub username. Then it will ask for any other engineers until there are no more to add.

After finishing up the engineer entries, the command line with ask about interns (name, ID number, email, and school they are from). It will keep asking the questions until you indicate that there are no other interns.
