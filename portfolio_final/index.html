                        My name is Alexander Griep but you can call me Alex. I am a nerd and proud of it. I believe that
                        we
                        all
                        should be who we are and like what we like. And if you don't like what I like and I don't like
                        what
                        you
                        like, there should be no problems between us.

                        I was born in Burnsville, MN on October 15th, 1987. I grew up in St. Anthony, MN, a small suburb
                        in
                        NE
                        Minneapolis, where I went to school from K to 12. From there, I went to the University of
                        Minnesota
                        -
                        Morris to obtain my BS in English.

                        After graduating from college, I traveled to China (Jiangmen and Jilin) to teach Oral English at
                        the
                        university level to Chinese students. After returning to the USA, I had a couple jobs for short
                        periods
                        of time until I landed at Medica for 1.5 years. After hiring way too many people to work in my
                        department, I was let go and finally landed at Target Corporation as a Sr. Collections
                        Specialist,
                        where
                        I work today.

                        From there, I started a web development bootcamp in order to try to move to a new position that
                        I
                        would
                        be more excited about. The progress of the class is amazing and so much information seems to
                        just be
                        flowing into my head. I feel upon completion of the bootcamp, I will be ready to continue be
                        able to
                        work on my skills and advance further into my chosen new field.
