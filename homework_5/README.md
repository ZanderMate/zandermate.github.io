# Unit 05 Homework - Day Planner

This assignment was a simple day calendar ranging from 9 am to 5 pm and allows the user to enter and save information on each text area within the hour.

On the top of the screen is the day of the week and the month and day for the current day.

Starting at 9 pm, the text area is colored red when that is the current hour and turns grey when the hour is finished, turning the next hour section to be red. If the hours is in the future, it is shown green until that hour becomes the current hour.

Once something is entered into the text area, the save button can be saved to add the contents of the text area to local storage, which will populate when the screen is refreshed or closed and opened later that day.
