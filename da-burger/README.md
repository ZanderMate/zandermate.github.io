## Instructions

1. Start by going to the heroku page: https://da-burger-zandermate.herokuapp.com/.

2. Type in a burger that you would like to try, pressing submit when finished. You should see you entry populate under the 'Ready to be Eaten' heading.

3. Pretend to eat the burger by pressing the "Time to Eat" button or if you change your mind, click the "Delete" button. If you press, "Time to Eat" you entry should move from under 'Ready to be Eaten' heading to the 'Already to be Eaten' heading with only the delete button.
